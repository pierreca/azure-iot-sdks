# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect {enter your device name here} device running {enter the OS name running on device} with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Computer with Git client installed 
-   {enter your device name here} device.
-   {{Please specify if any other software(s) or hardware(s) are required.}}

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   {{Write down the instructions required to setup, configure and connect your device. Please use external links when possible pointing to your own page with device preparation steps.}}

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Choose your commands in next steps based on the OS running on your device.

-   Run following command to check if NodeJS is already installed

        node --version

    If version is **0.12.x or greater**, then skip next step of installing prerequisite packages. Else uninstall it by issuing following command from command line on the device.{{***Keep the command set based on your OS and remove the rest.***}}

    {{**Debian or Ubuntu**}}

        sudo apt-get remove nodejs

    {{**Fedora**}}

        sudo dnf remove nodejs

    {{**Any Other Linux OS**}}

        Use equivalent commands on the target OS

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device. Choose your commands based on the OS running on your device.{{***Keep the command set based on your OS and remove the rest.***}}

    {{**Debian or Ubuntu**}}

        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -

        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

    {{**Fedora**}}

        wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.1/node-v4.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz

        tar xvf node-v4.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz

        sudo mv node-v4.2.1-linux-x64 /opt

        echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/opt/node-v4.2.1-linux-x64/bin" >> ~/.bashrc

        source ~/.bashrc

    {{**Any Other Linux OS**}}

        Use equivalent commands on the target OS

     {{***If any other software is required, please specify here the command(s) for installing same.***}}
     
    **Note:** To test successful installation of Node JS, try to fetch its version information by running following command:

        node --version

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    PuTTY:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory ~/azure-iot-sdks.

<a name="BuildSamples"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING='<iothub_connection_string>'

    Replace the `<iothub_connection_string>` placeholder with IoTHub Connection String you got in [Step 1](#Prerequisites).    

-   Run the following commands 

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node
        build/dev-setup.sh
        build/build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   Install npm package to run sample.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples

    **For AMQP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-amqp
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples
        nano simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

<a name="Run"></a>
## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
